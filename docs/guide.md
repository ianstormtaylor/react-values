## Installing `react-values`

To install `react-values` with Yarn or Npm, simply:

```bash
yarn add react-values
```

```bash
npm install --save react-values
```

You can then import any of its helpers into your code base:

```jsx
import { BooleanValue, NumberValue } from 'react-values'
```

> ðŸ¤– If you would rather import `react-values` with a `<script>` tag, you can use the bundled build:
>
> ```html
> <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-values/dist/react-values.min.js"></script>
> ```
>
> This will expose the `ReactValues` global with its components.

## Building a Component

With `react-values` installed, now you can start building components with it. For example, lets build a toggle with the `<BooleanValue>` helper.

To start, setup an non-interactive toggle component with some styles:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'react-emotion'

const Track = styled('div')`
  position: relative;
  height: 25px;
  width: 50px;
  background-color: ${props => (props.on ? 'lightgreen' : 'lightgray')};
  border-radius: 999px;
  cursor: pointer;
`

const Thumb = styled('div')`
  position: absolute;
  transition: all 0.25s;
  height: 23px;
  width: 23px;
  top: 1px;
  left: ${props => (props.on ? '26px' : '1px')};
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 999px;
  cursor: pointer;
`

const Toggle = () => (
  <Track>
    <Thumb />
  </Track>
)
```

Which you can render like so:

```jsx
<Toggle />
```

This works, but the toggle is not interactive. It has no way of managing any state, so it's always just "off".

## Introducing State

To make it stateful, lets use a `<BooleanValue>` helper from `react-values`:

```jsx
import { BooleanValue } from 'react-values'

const Toggle = () => (
  <BooleanValue>
    {({ value, toggle }) => (
      <Track on={value} onClick={toggle}>
        <Thumb on={value} />
      </Track>
    )}
  </BooleanValue>
)
```

Now your toggle derives its `on` state from the `value` prop passed it to by the `<BooleanValue>` component.

When you click on it, it uses the provided `toggle` transform to flip the boolean. As soon as this happens, `<BooleanValue>` re-renders, and your toggle is now on!

> ðŸ¤– Booleans are fairly simple pieces of state, so the `toggle()` transform is all you can really do. But depending on which type of value you're working with `react-values` will provide all sorts of convenient transforms. Check out the [API Reference](./reference.md) for a full list.

This is great, it's a working toggle!

But we're not done yet... There is no way to observe the toggle as it changes, so it's not all that useful. Let's fix that...

## Observing Changes

To observe the toggle's state, you can pass in an `onChange` prop to the `<BooleanValue>`:

```jsx
const Toggle = ({ onChange }) => (
  <BooleanValue onChange={onChange}>
    {({ value, toggle }) => (
      <Track on={value} onClick={toggle}>
        <Thumb on={value} />
      </Track>
    )}
  </BooleanValue>
)
```

Now you can listen for changes to the toggle by passing in an `onChange` handler:

```jsx
<Toggle onChange={value => ...} />
```

## Setting Defaults

If you want to share this component with others, they might ask you to be able to start the component in the "on" state instead of in the "off" state.

To do this, use the `defaultValue` prop:

```jsx
const Toggle = ({ defaultValue, onChange }) => (
  <BooleanValue defaultValue={defaultValue} onChange={onChange}>
    {({ value, toggle }) => (
      <Track on={value} onClick={toggle}>
        <Thumb on={value} />
      </Track>
    )}
  </BooleanValue>
)
```

That way people can do:

```jsx
<Toggle
  defaultValue={true}
  onChange={value => ...}
/>
```

## Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

But wait! What if someone wants to use the toggle in a "controlled" manner, just like you can with React's native `<input>` and `<select>` components.

To do that, you can use the `value` prop:

```jsx
const Toggle = ({ value, defaultValue, onChange }) => (
  <BooleanValue value={value} defaultValue={defaultValue} onChange={onChange}>
    {({ value, toggle }) => (
      <Track on={value} onClick={toggle}>
        <Thumb on={value} />
      </Track>
    )}
  </BooleanValue>
)
```

Now anyone who renders the toggle can choose whether they want to use it in a "controlled" manner or an "uncontrolled" manner, by passing either a `value` or a `defaultValue`:

```jsx
<Toggle
  value={true}
  onChange={value => ...}
/>

<Toggle
  defaultValue={true}
  onChange={value => ...}
/>
```

## Disabling Components

You can also pass in a `disabled` prop to disable the value helper. This will make it so that it ignores any state changes, just like how React's native `<input>` and `<select>` components do.

```jsx
const Toggle = ({ value, defaultValue, disabled, onChange }) => (
  <BooleanValue
    value={value}
    defaultValue={defaultValue}
    disabled={disabled}
    onChange={onChange}
  >
    {({ value, toggle }) => (
      <Track on={value} onClick={toggle}>
        <Thumb on={value} />
      </Track>
    )}
  </BooleanValue>
)
```

Then anyone can disable the component with:

```jsx
<Toggle
  value={true}
  disabled={true}
  onChange={value => ...}
/>
```

## Spreading Props

Let's refactor, just for simplicity's sake. You'll notice how we were passing the props in explicitly, but to make your code even simpler you can just spread them directly onto the `<BooleanValue>` instead:

```jsx
const Toggle = props => (
  <BooleanValue {...props}>
    {({ value, toggle }) => (
      <Track on={value} onClick={toggle}>
        <Thumb on={value} />
      </Track>
    )}
  </BooleanValue>
)
```

There you have it! Thanks to the `<BooleanValue>` helper component handling the state management for you, you've implemented a fully functional toggle in just a few lines of codeâ€”and it can be either controlled or uncontrolled!

And `react-values` handles more than just simple booleans. Check out the full [API Reference](./reference.md) to see everything you can do.

## Connecting Values

One last thing...

Sometimes you want to have a value that is synced between two (or more) different places in your render tree. Maybe users can open a modal in multiple ways, or there's a global search box, etc.

`react-values` gives you special factory functions for creating "connected" value components for this exact purpose.

For example, you can create a connected boolean:

```js
const ModalOpenedValue = createBooleanValue()
```

And then you can render it in multiple places:

```jsx
<App>
  <Content>
    <ModalOpenedValue>
      {({ toggle }) => <Button onClick={toggle}>Open Modal</Button>}
    </ModalOpenedValue>
  </Content>
  <ModalOpenedValue>
    {({ value, toggle }) =>
      value && (
        <Modal>
          <Button onClick={toggle}>Close</Button>
        </Modal>
      )
    }
  </ModalOpenedValue>
</App>
```

This is just a simple example, so the components live fairly close together in the render tree. But this isn't always the case, they can be extremely far apart (or even inside portals) and still share a connected value.

Any of them can trigger changes to the value and all of them will re-render.

This can eliminate one of the biggest reasons people turn to libraries like Redux or Mobx, to share state between components. And with `react-values` it's extremely simple, using the same old render props.
